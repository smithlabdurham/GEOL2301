                In this exercise, you will learn palaeoecological techniques by applying them to a real problem.
                You will study samples of the Much Wenlock formation, a mid-Silurian limestone that crops out near Dudley, Birmingham, and produce a short report, in the style of a submission to <i>Geology</i>, entitled 
                <em>Community structure, environment and ecological controls on the Wenlock Limestone fauna</em>.

                This is a multifaceted subject: you have flexibility in what aspects of the research question you choose to tackle, and how you approach it. Aside from the rubric below, you won&rsquo;t receive a step by step guide. Don&rsquo;t worry: this is an opportunity to develop your independent thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should collect data in <a class='wenlockGroups'>groups</a> of exactly two or three.
                You may informally discuss your data collection and interpretation, but must keep your own separate lab notebooks, and your analysis and written report must be produced <strong>completely independently</strong>.

                The course is structured around formative exercises that help you to make steady progress on your project as term progresses.
                Use these exercises to understand what you will need to do to produce an effective report.
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your initial task is to <a class="wenlockRubric">join a group</a>, 
                  choose a slab, and record its taxonomic composition.
                  In session 7, the class will pool its data in order to obtain a whole-class dataset.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In session 4, you will engage with the literature and produce an introduction to the report,
                  identifying previous work and outstanding questions that might be addressed using the techniques introduced in
                  the course so far.
                  These introductions will be reviewed by your peers in session 6 and will form the start of your final report.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your final report may integrate abundance and/or biovolume / biomass data from the entire cohort with detailed observations from your own slab – such as the way in which fossils are preserved.
                  You will present a first draft of your report in session 10, in order to receive comment from peers.
                  Should you be unable to meet the final deadline, this draft, which should be fundamentally complete,
                  may be used as a basis to award marks.

                <p>
                  A selection of mistakes commonly made by students:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Insufficient breadth and depth of research</li>
                  <li>Few analyses at an appropriate (L2) standard</li>
                  <li>Irrelevant material or analyses included</li>
                  <li>Interpretation ignores original observations, instead deferring to published literature</li>
                  <li>Poor structure: no clear narrative</li>
                  <li>Immature scientific style of writing – reading scientific papers improves knowledge and writing</li>
                  <li>Poor integration and synthesis of relevant topics and techniques learned across the module</li>

                  Good scientific writing often tells a story.
                  Bad writing presents an incoherent list of data points and analyses, without linking observations to the bigger picture.
                  Before you start and as you progress, ask yourself what conclusions you are hoping to draw and how each analysis or data point develops the narrative leading to those conclusions.
                  What belongs in the report? What can be left out? What structure most effectively conveys your argument?

                You should have learnt about searching the literature in your tutorials. Find useful sources by searching (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge) for keywords, by reading the reference lists of relevant papers, and by looking at papers that cite an article of interest. The “Access Scientific Articles” section on this module’s DUO page gives tips for accessing articles off campus.

                Results belong in a results section, where they should be clearly and concisely described.  Each figure or table should make a scientific point – raw data belong in a lab notebook.  
                Lay out your results in order to set up what you are about to say in the discussion.

                Discussion belongs in a discussion section.  This is your chance to apply your results to the research question. How do they build on previous work? Are there caveats to their interpretation, or do they point to a broader story you can build from the wider scientific literature?

                 Dig out your notes from your abstract-writing exercise in your L1 tutorials.
                 An abstract is a ‘paper in miniature’ that expands on the title. Though presented first, it is often best to write the abstract last, as it summarises the rest of your report.
