						<h2>Succession in practice</h2>
						<p>
              This session we'll be putting the quantitative approaches we met in the
              asynchronous session into practice.

              There's a lot to cover this week, so don't hesitate to call for help
              if it's taking a while to wrap your head around a particular concept.

                We're going to learn how to interpret life history by generating relevant
                plots from assemblage data, using R.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our data is drawn from Thayer (1977), and represents length measurements
                (in mm)
                from 42 terebratulid brachiopods that died between censuses conducted in
                1974 and 1975.

                <p>
                I've created a simple point-and-click interface that makes it simple
                to construct such curves, which will make this exercise as straightforward
                as possible.
                You will obtain a deeper understanding of each exercise if you construct 
                the plots yourself, perhaps using your favourite spreadsheet editor, or 
                R itself (you'll find code to get you started in some of the exercises.)

                    right of the mean (i.e. the centre of the reference normal 
                    distribution)?  This would denote a slight left skew, consistent
                    with the slightly negative skewness value (&minus;0.2153).

                      Skewness values smaller than ±0.5 are typically considered to be 
                      negligible, so you would be justified in treating terebratulid
                      length as normally distrubtued.

                    If infant mortality were high, then most dead brachiopods would be 
                    little, so we'd expect the peak of the distribution to be on the

                      CD5 is super-dominated by one species, even though

                      When ordered by rank abundance, do the bars look like they might

                    To backstrip the effect of sampling intensity (<i>n</i>) on
                    <i>S</i>, you need some concept of how many more rare species you 
                    will happen to see as you sample more individuals.
                    
                    You can then 'shrink' <i>S</i> by this function of <i>n</i>.

                  <strong>Menhinick’s</strong> and <strong>Margalef’s</strong>
                  richness 'indices' are two attempts to normalize the number of species
                  observed based on the number of individuals sampled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The two approaches differ in their concept of how many more 
                  'rare' species we expect to see as we sample more individuals: 
                  
                  Menhinick's (<i>S</i> / √<i>n</i>) posits that 
                  the number of species increases with the square root of 
                  the number of individuals sampled; 
                  
                  Margalef's ((<i>S</i> – 1) / ln <i>n</i>) that <i>S</i>
                  should increase with the logarithm of sample size.
                  
                  Empirically, which is a better model seems to vary from
                  assemblage to assemblage, so neither is necessarily “better”.

                <h3>Dominance indices</h3>
                <p>
                  Now let’s consider how we might measure <strong>dominance</strong>.
                </p><p>
                  It's a good idea to measure this using an <strong>index</strong>:
                  mathematically, an index is a dimensionless value that ranges from 
                  zero to one.  In this context, a value of one should denote 
                  maximum dominance; zero, maximum evenness.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  
                  The simplest measure, and the one that you are perhaps most likely
                  to encouter, is the Berger&ndash;Parker index.  The BPI is the 
                  proportion of the <i>n</i> individuals that belong to the most 
                  common taxon (<i>n<sub>t</sub></i>) – 
                  i.e. <i>n<sub>t</sub></i> / <i>n</i>.

                  Entropy is a measure of information (the average information content

                  Now we will transform our data to generate rank-abundance plots.

                    In the Diversity app, select "Order by rank abundance". 
                    That's the 'rank' bit taken care of.

                  <li>
                    We need to log-transform the abundance – handily, there's a box for 
                    that too.  Make sure it's checked.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To make the graph easier to interpret, we want to rotate it,
                    and present it as points rather than bars.  
                    Select "Scatter plot" to accomplish this.

                  <li>
                    You can add a 'line of best fit' with the "Fit (log)linear" option:
                    useful for evaluating possible geometric distributions.

                    Do any assemblages approximate (loosely) the straight line expected of a geometric distribution?
                    Do others approximate the S-shape of the log-normal distribution, with few common and few rare species?

                    Don’t get thrown by “steps” in the data associated with jumps from one integer count to the next.
                    Many species may be represented by a single individual – you can’t count 1.3 brachiopods.

                      CD6, and perhaps CD7–9, almost look linear:
                      but can you detect that faint S-shape?
                      The most abundant species are certainly more dominant than 
                      predicted by a geometric model.

                    <p>
                      Octave plots reveal a possible log-normal distribution for these
                      assemblages; the high values of Shapiro's <i>p</i> (> 0.05) 
                      indicate that a log-normal distribution cannot be rejected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many others assemblages, e.g. CD2–3, have one or two superabundant 
                      species far above the line – perhaps representing ‘pioneers’?
                      Could these counts represent an artefact of some sort? 
                      Would this affect the bigger picture?

                      Lower log shows stable, ?low resource, ?low oxygen = stressful settings.
                      Low energy suggests that detritovores might dominate.                    
                      Might occasional anoxia stop ecosystems maturing to climax communities?

                      Over time, energy levels increase (decrease in water depth?).
                      Suspension feeding becomes preferable?
                      Shallower water → photic zone; more food → more predators → more diversity?
                      Climax communities becoming established, with log-normal distribution.
