          <h2>Ichnology</h2>
          <p>
            Fossil organisms are not the only tool at the
            palaeoecologist’s disposal.
            Trace fossils provide evidence
            of animal behaviour in the sedimentary record.
            The
            strengths and weaknesses of ichnological traces
            complement those of conventional fossils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trace fossils, broadly, are evidence of biological activity
            preserved in the sedimentary record. Trace fossils include
            footprints, trackways, burrows, borings, and other
            structures, whether preserved in soft sediment or as
            impressions on shells or skeletal elements. Bioimmuration
            is further, particularly gruesome, category.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike shelly fossils, trace fossils in a sedimentary
            substrate (sand, mud) cannot be transported, and thus
            unequivocally reflect the environment at the place of
            deposition (though not necessarily at a single point in time).
            Because traces can be made by taxa with or without
            biomineralizing ‘hard parts’, the trace fossil record is
            affected by a very different set of preservational biases than
            the conventional fossil record.

              With few exceptions, it is difficult to determine the exact
              biological identity of a trace maker – very different taxa
              can produce very similar impressions on the sediment,
              particularly if they share similar behavioural modes.
              Conversely, behaviours that only occur in specific settings
              can give rise to trace fossils that are distinctive to a very
              specific depositional environment. As such there are a
              variety of different classification schemes based around
              different properties of trace fossils.

                Can we not just name trace fossils after the organism that
                created them? This can pose some challenges, both in terms
                of identifying the trace maker, and ‘unsquashing’ sedimentary layers.

                Another way to classify trace fossils is according to the
                type of behaviour that generated them – common categories
                include dwelling traces, grazing traces and resting traces.
                As different behaviours suit different sedimentary
                environments, the mode of behaviour expressed can help to
                resolve certain characteristics of the likely depositional
                environment.

                Around a dozen separate ichnofacies – that is, distinctive
                environments characterized by recurrent and particular
                assemblages of ichnofossils – have been proposed.
                We won’t meet them all: we’ll focus on the four marine softground 
                ichnofacies, as these occur consistently through space and time (since the
                Cambrian, at least!).

                Ichnofacies are typically named after an ichnogenus that 
                characteristically occurs within them, so trace fossil assemblages 
                deposited in the <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies often (but not always) 
                include the ichnogenus <i>Skolithos</i>, but may alternatively contain 
                some or all of <i>Arenicolites</i>, <i>Diplocraterion</i> 
                and/or <i>Ophiomorpha</i>.

                <li class="hidden written answer" id="Skolithos">
                    This ichnofacies corresponds to shallow water (high
                  energy, possibly intertidal) settings with relatively clean
                  and unconsolidated sandy sediment. 
                  Most of its inhabitants are suspension feeders that sit in the sand as
                  they feed; such creatures might produce simple vertical or
                  U-shaped dwelling burrows (<i>Skolithos</i>, <i>Arenicolites</i>).
                  To keep pace with influxes of sediment or periods of erosion,
                  the burrows may need to move up or down, leaving
                  evidence of vertical movement (<i>spreiten</i>) as they migrate
                  (<i>Diplocraterion</i>).
                  Another characteristic ichnogenus of the <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies is 
                  <strong><i>Ophiomorpha</i></strong>.
                  <i>Ophiomorpha</i> comprises networks of burrows; in order to stop them 
                  collapsing, burrow walls are lined with a stucco of faecal pellets.

                <li class="hidden written answer" id="Cruziana">
                  This ichnofacies typifies shallow marine settings with
                  poorly sorted, mud-rich (and therefore cohesive) sediments
                  set in areas of low to medium energy. Such settings are
                  compatible with both deposit and suspension feeding,
                  giving rise to reasonable biodiversity and plenty of
                  opportunity for predation. <i>Cruziana</i> itself represents the
                  locomotion of (predatory?) trilobite-like arthropods,
                  whereas <i>Rusophycus</i> is a resting trace of the same
                  organisms.
                  The more placid and stable environment is
                  more compatible with horizontal burrowing than the
                  <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies. 
                  <i>Rhizocorallium</i> are sub-horizontal U-shaped burrows thought to be 
                  made by burrowing depositfeeding worms, showing spreiten superficially 
                  similar to those of <i>Diplocraterion</i>.
                  <i>Palaeophycus</i> is another ichnogenus of unbranching, horizontal burrow.

                <li class="hidden written answer" id="Zoophycos">
                  This ichnofacies is associated with sediments that are fine
                  grained (silty clays or muds) and organic rich, with slow
                  deposition rates. As such the sediments are often prone to
                  periods of low oxygen conditions and intensely bioturbated.
                  Such conditions are common in distal settings and deeper
                  waters (below storm wave base) but can occur elsewhere.
                  In such low-energy settings, deposit feeding is of course
                  dominant. <i>Zoophycos</i> itself looks something like a broad
                  spiral staircase, with lots of lateral burrows corresponding
                  to the steps as it screws down into deeper sediments. The
                  trace fossil assemblage is typically low diversity (perhaps
                  owing to periodic anoxia); another taxon that might be
                  encountered is the branching, root-like <i>Chondrites</i>, itself
                  thought to prosper in low oxygen conditions; it has been
                  suggested that the burrow system serves to culture
                  methanogenic bacteria.

                <li class="hidden written answer" id="Nerites">
                  The <i>Nerites</i> ichnofacies occurs in deep marine settings;
                  sediment typically rains down from the overlying water at
                  incredibly slow rates, with occasional interruptions from
                  sandy turbidite packages.
                  With food scarce and sometimes occurring in thin horizontal layers 
                  (perhaps corresponding to the fallout of an algal bloom, for example),
                  deposit feeders are careful to cover ground as efficiently as
                  possible, perhaps by spiralling out from a central point
                  (<i>Spirorhaphe</i>), or perhaps by mapping out a labyrinth-like
                  pattern by sticking as close as possible to previous burrows
                  (<i>Helminthoida</i>).
                  <i>Nereites</i> itself is a more meandering trace,
                  again horizontal, with lateral lobes. <i>Palaeodictyon</i> is a
                  more unusual trace in the form of a horizontal hexagonal grid;
                  the trace maker would have cultivated bacteria on the
                  walls of the grid, left them to grow using nutrients in the
                  sediment, then fed on the bacteria once they had flourished.

                Bryozoans are both a substrate that can contain impressions of other
                organisms, and a permanent impression of competitive interactions
                – offering a complementary glance into ancient behaviour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cheilostomes win two-thirds of their competitive interactions with members
                of the other bryozoan group, the cyclostomes; this can be attributed to
                their competitive advantages: larger zooid size; outward-directed 
                exhalent flow; often more sophisticated colony structure. 
                (Some colonies even have a specialist class of frontier zooids that 
                do not feed or reproduce, but are basically giant pincers that
                nip any competitor that gets too close.)

                  If cheilostomes tend to outcompete cyclostomes whenever the two meet,
                  why are cyclostomes not on a trajectory to extinction?

                <li class="hidden written answer" id="bryox">
                  <p>
                    One explanation is that cyclostomes are much better at dispersal and 
                    colonisation: they can rapidly colonise a new substrate before 
                    cheilostomes can get established, and have already spread their genes
                    to a new site before they are smothered by a cyclostome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Is this explanation consistent with the differences in characteristics
                    between cheilostomes and cyclostomes?
