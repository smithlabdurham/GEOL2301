          <h2>Higher Classification</h2>
          <p>
            Do species share similarities, or roles in an ecosystem, due
            to selective evolutionary pressures – or simply due to
            shared ancestry? Today we explore the vocabulary of
            relatedness, allowing us to express how taxa are related – a
            cornerstone of evolutionary biology.

              A <strong>phylogeny</strong> is the evolutionary history of a lineage, most
              clearly represented as a phylogenetic tree. A tree implies a
              number of branching points (nodes), corresponding to
              cladogenesis: one lineage becoming two. Between each
              pair of branching points is a branch, corresponding to some
              period of evolutionary time, in which a lineage may have
              accumulated morphological change.

                Morphological changes that arise once (i.e. on a single

                backbone of phylogenetic reconstruction. Such characters
                define a <strong>monophyletic group</strong>
                (from greek mono-, single, -phylum, tribe; also referred to as a 
                <strong>clade</strong>), which comprises
                a single common ancestor and all its descendants. 
                A <strong>paraphyletic group</strong> contains a common ancestor and
                some, but not all, of its descendants, whereas a
                <strong>polyphyletic group</strong> (many-tribes) comprises lots of
                different groups, but not their common ancestor.

                In short, relatedness should be calculated by looking for a 
                most recent common ancestor.  Everything descended from an ancestor
                is more closely related to each other than to anything that doesn't 
                share that ancestor.

                Fossils, particularly old ones, are often harder than living taxa to classify.
                This is because, on account of their ‘primitive’ condition, they often lack some or all of the key characters that identify a modern group. 
                (Cladogenesis is not necessarily accompanied by immediate morphological change.)  Rigid Linnean terms – the hierarchy of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species – lack the flexibility to accommodate early offshoots of the evolutionary lineages leading to extant clades.

                How are the higher taxa defined?  Linnaeus (1735) might almost have used the aisles of his local pet shop to define his six ‘body plans’.  Cuvier (1817) emphasized the disparity of Linnaeus’s “Vermes”, instead using the pre-Darwinian concept of a “chain of being” to classify organisms by complexity, and thus sophistication – with man just one step lower than the angels.

                Until the 1990s, groups were defined based on a shared evolutionary history, inferred from shared homologous features – for example, body segmentation.  But morphological characteristics are prone to convergent evolution: similar features – indeed similar overall morphologies – may arise in distantly related organisms in response to similar physical, environmental or ecological pressures.  In the new age of cheap molecular sequencing, some long-standing relationships have been overturned on the basis of shared genetic sequences that can only be so similar (we assume) if they were inherited from a common ancestor.

                <strong>Phenetics</strong> aims to group taxa according to their similarity, rather than their evolutionary relationships.
                Taxa that look similar are grouped together, whether or not their similarity is inherited from a common ancestor.
                (For this reason, phenetic groups are often polyphyletic.)
                Phenetics can sometimes get a bad press, and there is no consistent framework for ‘phenetic classification’, but it offers a neat way of exploring how the nature of organisms has changed through time.

                Organisms might be grouped by morphological similarity, or by ecological similarity.
                A fundamental ecological distinction might be made between autotrophs (self-feeding – often photosynthetic) and heterotrophs (other-feeding – grazers or predators, perhaps).
                A more nuanced ecological classification uses three primary dimensions of tiering, feeding and motility, which can be exploded into a 6×6×6 cube; the occupancy of this cube through time offers an interesting window on how ecological possibility has been more thoroughly explored through the Phanerozoic.
                An equivalent endeavour is the mapping of <strong>disparity</strong> (diversity of form) through time.
                On a finer scale still, an ecosystem might be divided into individual <strong>niches</strong> – particular living conditions – with each niche occupied by a distinct species that is adapted for that particular niche.
                Communities that look very different – perhaps separated by space or time – may have a similar underlying ecological structure; equivalent niches may have different occupants yet the overall structure of the ecosystem may be the same.

                      Did it take a while for the ocean to be oxygenated,
                      and sufficiently productive, to support energy- and
                      oxygen-intensive modes of life, such as fast, deep-burrowing
                      mining?

                    <li>
                      Could this trend towards productivity itself be biologically
                      mediated, with gradual ecological escalation driven by increased
                      efficiency of primary production supporting larger populations, 
                      increasing energy availability and thus permitting ever more
                      active modes of predation, leading to ever more active prey?

              <p>Here are some optional long-form questions to help cement your understanding of this week's content.</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="question">
                  What are the advantages and disadvantages to the three main approaches to classification?
                </li>
                <textarea placeholder="No 'official' answer for this question. What can you come up with?"></textarea>
                <li class="question" onclick="Reveal('recapClass');">
                  How might our perpsectives on diversity differ under 
                  (i) a Linnean, rank-based approach to classification; 
                  (ii) a cladistic, stem-and-crown approach to classification?
                </li>
                <li class="hidden written answer" id='recapClass'>
                  <p>Headlines: A Linnean approach might lump together different 'body plans'
                    (e.g. birds & dinosaurs, molluscan classes), making a rank look like
                    it contains more or less diversity than it really does. 
                    Counting ranks could oversimplify the true diversity / disparity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A cladistic approach allows a more precise (and meaningful?)
                    classification of fossil material,
                    though is not necesssarily as amenable to a
                    quantitative approach.
                    As the transition from stem to crown group is simply defined by
                    what happens not to have gone extinct, it perhaps makes more 
                    explicit the basis on which group membership is defined.

                For the practical session, and the <a href="wenlock.html">Wenlock exercise</a>, you'll need to obtain
                a lab notebook.  This needn't be anything fancy – any bound A4 notebook will do – but you may have
                or develop your own preferences – some students like particular combinations 
                of squared, lined and blank pages, for example.
