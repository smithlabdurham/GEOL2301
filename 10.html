            As plenty of crime dramas insinuate, if you want to understand a complex
            situation, you ought to follow the money. The currency of ecosystems is biomass (more strictly, embedded energy?) – and understanding biomass flows can account for a surprising variety of ecological trends and macroevolutionary phenomena.

                Maximum body size is an oft-discussed property of the palaeontological record. Cope’s law asserts (imprecisely and unprofoundly) that maximum body size tends to increase within a given lineage over geological time. But is there a physical limit to maximum body size, and are whales at it?
              </p>
              <p>
                One upper bound on body size is given by the flow of energy up food chains.  The largest animal needs to be able to find enough food to sustain it.  And in the planktic realm (open oceans), predators are always larger than their prey – specialized prey-capture appendages would cause prohibitive drag, so swallowing is the only means of eating.

                One might expect biomass to decrease up the Eltonian (trophic) pyramid: shouldn’t there be more whale food in the ocean than there is whale?  
                What does the biomass distribution actually look like – a pyramid (upright or inverted)? An hourglass? A skyscraper?

                Note that 99% of marine animals die when they are eaten.
                This creates an implicit linkage between the feeding rate in one tier

                Before you watch the next video, suggest what relative values these
                factors would have to take to produce a steady-state trophic strucure
                in the shape of:

                  <p>
                    At steady state, population size is constant, so death must be 
                    offset by recruitment (young individuals being born and growing up).
                    We can ignore these factors.

                  <p>
                    Particles move up the pyramid when an organism grows (promotion)
                    or when it is fed upon (feeding).
                    Biomass is lost down the pyramid by excretion, which is linked to 
                    metabolic rate.  (Note how this simple situation becomes more complicated if small organisms can feed on larger ones.)
                  </p>
                
                  <p>
                    If metabolism/waste production is high, then at a given feeding
                    rate, growth will be slow; mass will trickle down the trophic scale
                    faster than it can move up, leaving a classic pyramid shape.

                  This represents the opposite scenario: if life is very efficient,
                  and nothing is wasted, then biomass can only move up the trophic 
                  structure, and the pyramid will be inverted.
                  It is difficult to envisage how such a situation can be stable
                  over the long term.

              <p>
                The constant gradient reflects a constant ratio of predator : prey size,

                Lifespan, feeding and growth rate all reflect metabolic rate, which also scales with particle size (gradient: ¾).  This is to say, larger organisms eat, grow, live and die more slowly, balancing their larger size.

                The top storey of the trophic skyscraper must contain at least one individual.  In practice, minimum viable population size is much larger: in the order of hundreds for terrestrial mammals (pandas) and hundreds of thousands for marine fish.  
                There were about this many blue whales until we almost exterminated them through overfishing: there's nothing larger than a blue whale because
                a sustainable population of larger organisms would need to eat more food
                than the planet's oceans can produce.

                    Evidence for improved efficiency: increase in deposit feeding in deep (nutrient poor) waters – <i>Nereites</i> ichnofacies – attributed to evolution of new hyper-efficient biological solutions.

                    Counterargument: simply less food in these settings in the Cambrian (because less productivity).

                  <p>
                    Support for counterargument: Deep-water burrowing occurs in Cambrian where nutrients supplied. In modern oceans, burrowing depth tracks surface productivity.

                    Efficiency does allow larger body sizes when resources are scarce (less energy lost to metabolism).  But where resources are freely available, efficient organisms have been displaced by energetic organisms.

                Active modes of life have displaced efficient modes of life to
                nutrient-poor (<strong>oligotrophic</strong>) refugia – 
                in order to see more fuel-efficient cars, just make fuel scarcer (dearer).

                “High energy” lifestyles include active burrowing (pushing sediment aside is wasted energy), predation (failed pursuits waste energy).

                These lifestyles can incidentally complicate the ‘easy’ lives of more efficient organisms.
                Interestingly, lineages do not tend to change their ‘energeticness’ / efficiency / effectiveness of nutrient capture very much as they evolve.  Rather, new strategies for effective resource use evolve suddenly as a ‘new major group’ develops in a new trophic guild (which came first is an interesting question).
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, lineages seem to show a trend to decreasing evolvability through time: all the ‘low hanging’ evolutionary fruit have been picked, and subsequent mutations are more likely to have a smaller effect. (cf. ‘key innovation’ model of evolution.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, changes in energetics of organisms tend to represent the arrival of new, ‘caffeinated’ lineages (‘bullies’), which displace existing lineages into oligotrophic refugia.
                These new lineages are often members of the Recent Fauna (III),
                which predominantly comprise high-energy taxa; in the Palaeozoic, the
                high energy requirements of such taxa could only be met in the most
                productive places on Earth, but the across-the-board increase in
                productivity through the Recent meant that their high demands could be
                met in progressively more settings – whereas the low nutrient settings 
                preferred by the Palaeozoic fauna were now found in settings that were
                previously too nutrient-scarce to support life at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                This fits with the long-term picture: diversity is predominantly added into previously unoccupied guilds. Perhaps these were unoccupied because they were not energetically feasible, as not enough biomass was available to sustain them?

              <h4>A short story: "The Starbucks Effect"</h4>
              <p style="font-style: italic";>
                Once upon a time there was a sleepy college library in which a few
                students quietly worked.
                When the librarian installed a coffee machine, a new breed of students appeared.  These students needed coffee to function.  
                They elbowed the other students aside on their charge to the coffee machine,
                and talked animatedly about their work.
                They got lots done – but the old students didn't like it.
                They drifted away to find another quiet corner to work in.

                  Indirectly!  Some isotopic approaches show promise, 
                  but the best tested route is to measure the diversity of phytoplankton.
                  Of course, there are taphonomic concerns, particularly when a new
                  group of phytoplankton with a different skeletal composition starts

                  Nutrient availability is more important than light or temperature.
                  Iron limits cyanobacteria; phosphorous limits eukaryotic plankton.
                  These nutrients may be recycled by overturning ocean circulation, 
                  but their ultimate source is terretrial weathering.
                  Plants greatly increase weathering rate, primarily via their roots;
                  vegetation cover and rooting depth can account for some of the 
                  first-order trends in primary productivity and thus marine biodiversity.
