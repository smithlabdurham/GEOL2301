						<h2>Trophic structure</h2>
						<p>The trophic structure of an ecosystem describes the flow of resources 
                  from primary producers to higher levels of the food chain.
                  Primary producers mark the bottom of the <strong>trophic pyramid</strong>.
                  As a means of generating biomass, eating is around 10% efficient; 
                  as such, higher levels of the trophic pyramid represent progressively 
                  rarer components of living communities.

                  Simple answer: Photosynthesis requires shallow water: <&nbsp;200&nbsp;m

                  Most photosynthesis is conducted by phytoplankton.
                  Though individually tiny, they can live anywhere in the top 200&nbsp;m
                  of the oceans – an enormous volume, in contrast to macroalgae,
                  which can only live close to shallow sea floors – i.e. 
                  fringing continents.
                  Seaweeds are thus individually large and locally important, but only
                  account for a couple of percent of the total carbon fixation of the

              </div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p>In terrestrial ecosystems, typical occupants of the higher levels of 
                the trophic pyramid are herbivores (on level two) and carnivores 
                (whether active predators or scavengers). 
                Marine ecosystems differ from terrestrial ones in that there is an 
                abundance of food available in the form of suspended organic matter:
                these particles include <strong>phytoplankton</strong> 
                (<strong>autotrophic</strong> micro-organisms that 
                are typically photosynthetic and often unicellular),
                <strong>zooplankton</strong> (<strong>heterotrophic</strong> animals such 
                as krill that feed on phytoplankton), and <strong>faecal pellets</strong>
                that rapidly transport organic matter to the sea floor.
                </p>
                
                <p>The fate of these particles, as with any other sedimentary particle,
                depends on the energy levels at the sea floor.  
                In high energy environments, the particles will typically be suspended in 
                the seawater as waves and currents churn them up;
                in low energy environments, the particles will settle on the sea bed 
                and eventually be buried.

                which feed on particles in suspension –
                will be more abundant in high-energy environments, 
                whereas <strong>deposit feeders</strong> – which extract organic material 
                (particles and the bacteria that degrade them) from the mud of the sea bed
                – tend to proliferate low energy environments.</p>
                
                <h3>Where primary consumers live</h3>
                <p>The proportion of <strong>infaunal</strong> consumers may reflect
                oxygen levels within the sediment, but is particularly vulnerable
                to distortion by preservational processes. 
                (Why might this be?  
                You should think about this again after the Taphonomy session).
                </p>
                
                <p>The nature and abundance of <strong>epifaunal</strong> consumers may 
                reflect the firmness of the substrate – soupy sediment lacks attachment 
                points and can
                only be colonized by ‘floating’ taxa (icebergs / snow shoes).

              Hopefully you are starting to see how the observed abundance of organisms in 
              different sediment niches can be used to infer the environment.

                <li class='answer hidden' id='q1a'>
                  Hmm... In calm waters, food particles quickly settle to the sea floor.
                  This means that there aren&rsquo;t enough particles suspended in the water to
                  keep suspension feeders well fed.  But deposit feeders can feast on the 
                  particles that settle out into the muds – so these will be more abundant
                  than suspension feeders.

                  Correct!  Storms and tidal currents will frequenly lift food particles

                  With little oxygen dissolved in the seawater,
                  it's difficult to meet the oxygen requirements for metabolism whilst 
                  buried below the sediment – oxygen's rate of diffusion is low, so a lot
                  of energy must be expended to keep burrows ventilated.

                  Hmm... Below storm wave base, it's hard to imagine a source of energy that
                  will consistently create currents to suspend food particles.

                  This highly erosive setting is likely to be amply oxygenated to allow
                  for infaunal organisms: the challenge they'll face is burrowing into
                  the rocky substrate, which may host a rich diversity of epifaunal
                  suspension feeders and vagrant grazers.

                  Beach waves introduce plenty of oxygen into the water, and a firm sand
                  can be a great substrate for burrowing – but wave action makes 
                  dwelling on the surface less attractive. 
                  The balance here favours infaunal organisms.

						<h2>Predators and Diversity</h2>
						<p>The upper layers of our trophic pyramid comprise the predators; predator
            diversity is closely linked to the overall diversity of an assemblage
            (and you may wish to ponder when it might be appropriate to measure one of 
            these rather than the other).</p>

                <p>Diversity itself is controlled by a number of factors.
                A fundamental control is the evenness of the environment: 
                a varied habitat will contain multiple different niches, 
                which different species will be differentially adapted to. 
                Note that diversity itself can increase the variedness of an environment: 
                the arrival of a number of clams might offer opportunities for encrusting
                or predatory taxa, and may provide shelter for yet other taxa.

                <p>On the whole, comfortable environments give rise to high diversity.
                Fewer taxa can survive in stressed environments, such as brackish water
                (a mixture of freshwater and sea water, found for example in estuarine 
                environments) or dysoxic conditions, reducing total diversity.
                In contrast, areas that are high in resources tend to be associated with 
                higher diversity. 
                Diversity tends to peak at low latitudes: one reason being that higher
                temperatures improve primary productivity (i.e. more resources), 
                another being the creation of a long temperature gradient between warm 
                surface waters and cool deep waters, making for a more varied environment. 
                Diversity also changes during ecological succession: more on this next time.

                  All else being equal, which is likely to contain a higher

                <li class='answer hidden' id='dv1a'>
                  Hmm&hellip; a low diversity suggests an adverse environment, though
                  I <em>did</em> say that all else was equal.  Typically, low-diversity
                  assemblages are expecially low in predators.
                </li>
                <li class='option' onclick="Right(this, 'dv1b');">
                  A community of a thousand species
                </li>
                <li class='answer hidden' id='dv1b'>
                  Correct!  There are a number of reasons that higher diversity might 
                  correspond to a higher proportion of predators.  
                  High diversity suggests stability, and gives predators more opportunities
                  to specialise to prey on specific species – creating more niches, and
                  thus allowing more species to be sustained.  
                  And each species of predator might in turn be prey to its own species
                  of hunter: more species means that food chains can be longer, 
                  adding extra tiers of predators (and thus more species) to the top of
                  trophic pyramids.                  
                </li>
                <li class='option' onclick="Wrong(this, 'dv1c');">
                  Neither – there's no reason for one to have a higher proportion of predators
                </li>
                <li class='answer hidden' id='dv1c'>
                  Think again.  How might the number of species influence the height of
                  a trophic pyramid and the length of its constituent food chains?
                </li>
                
                <li class='question' onclick="Reveal('dv2');">
                  Given the differences in the number of species between the assemblages
                  above, the "all else being equal" claim is pretty unlikely.
                  How are the environments of the two assemblages likely to differ?
                </li>
                <li class='hidden answer' id='dv2'>
                  A higher total diversity suggests a stable, resource-rich, low-stress 
                  environment in which many different specialist species can prosper
                  at sufficient population sizes that finding a mate is never a problem.
                </li>
                
                <li class='question'>
                  Which of the two communities below is likely to have a higher diversity?
                </li>
                <li class='option' onclick="Wrong(this, 'dv3a');">
                  A community where most taxa are generalists
                </li>
                <li class='answer hidden' id='dv3a'>
                  <p>Generalists tend to do well in unpredictable environments, where they
                  need to be ready for whatever tomorrow throws at them; and to high-stress
                  environments, when specialists divert too many resources to specialization
                  and so don't have any spare to cope with stressful conditions.
                  This doesn't sound like a setting that favours diversity.
                  </p><p>From a more pragmatic perspective, generalists tend not to be
                  adapted to specific niches, suggesting a homogeneous and thus low-diversity
                  ecosystem.</p>
                 
                </li>
                <li class='option' onclick="Right(this, 'dv3b');">
                  A community where most taxa are specialists
                </li>
                <li class='answer hidden' id='dv3b'>
                  Correct. Specialists can occupy niches that are more tightly defined, 
                  thus allowing more species to be packed into a given gradient of 
                  resource availability, temperature, etc.
