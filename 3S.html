              This practical will introduce you to trilobites and brachiopods.  You should also have time to meet the bryozoans and corals.  Together these four groups are perhaps the most abundant and important that lived during the Palaeozoic.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re going to consider the process of classification, and along the way try to learn how best to study fossil material.  There is often more to a fossil than meets the eye, and the art of identifying fossils and extracting data from them is largely a process of training the eye to make careful observations.

                </p><p>
                  Sketching fossils is important not just because it allows you to remember what the fossil looked like later – a photograph could do that – but also because it forces you to observe and interpret features in the specimen.
                  When you were just looking at the fossil, you might not have paid much attention to the number of ridges (say) or the angle between them – sketching a fossil compels you to observe such details.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>
                  Using appropriate terminology is also enormously helpful.
                  Unfamiliar terms can be a pain to memorize, but it’s much easier and more precise to say “facial suture” than “the wiggly line that runs along the head bit”, and someone else who knows the lingo will know straight away what you mean.
                  What is more, the vocabulary of technical terms is carefully chosen to refer to features that are homologous (i.e. equivalent, or inherited from a last common ancestor) within a group.
                  This means that the same word can be used for different fossils within that group, and often means that the absence of such and such a feature is in itself notable.
                  Finally, each term is something that can be described; once you know what a delthyrium is, you might notice differences in the delthyrium shape that you would otherwise have overlooked.
                </p><p>
                  Grab a pencil and paper and produce labelled sketches of the two fossils you have chosen.
                  Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://duo.dur.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/xid-21135769_2" title="Crib sheets on DUO">crib sheet</a> to see the terms as they apply to idealized fossils, then identify the features on your own fossils.
                  A good sketch need not be an artistic masterwork: focus on keeping your drawing as simple as possible, whilst depicting (and annotating) the key features of the fossil.  Use all the available space, drawing the fossil from different angles if necessary. 
                </p>
                <ul><li class="caution">
                  Remember to include a scale. 
                  Both these specimens are <i>circa</i> 80&nbsp;mm from head to tail.

                <ul>
                  Once you've completed your sketches, write a new list of the morphological differences between the specimens.

               Now we’ll attempt a systematic description of a new fossil.  Imagine for a moment that you have just pulled it out of a cliff face, and your expert friend tells you that it is new to science!  Naturally you’ll want to describe it as a new species.  Let’s work through the process of a formal description here.

                <h4>Figure</h4>
                <p>
                  No description is complete without a figure of the new taxon: people will need to see what it looks like!
                  Making an annotated sketch now will allow you to identify the diagnostic characteristics of the fossil.
                  Concentrate on labelling features that are important for classification.

                    Key features include: size &amp; shape of cephalon; presence of genal spines; eye shape and construction; relative size of pygidium; disposition of glabella.

                </ul>
                <h4>Classification</h4>
                <p>
                  Now we're ready to begin our formal description.  
                  The first step is to identify which larger group the new taxon belongs to.
                  Use your annotations, and the classification guide on the crib sheet, to identify the phylum, class, and order of your new species.
                </p>
                <h4>Name</h4>
              </div>

                <p>
                  Next, you need to name your species.
                  A binomial is the full name of a species: the name of the genus it belongs to, followed by its specific epithet (species-level name), written in italics with the name of the genus capitalized (i.e. <i>Genus species</i>).
                  For example, <i>Lingula rostrum</i> is a species (<i>rostrum</i>) of brachiopod in the genus <i>Lingula</i>.
                  Species names can be anything at all, so long as their binomial name is unique and pronounceable.
                  (There are species called ‘<i>rostrum</i>’ in other genera, for example the gastropod snail <i>Calliotropis rostrum</i>; this is why the genus name is always given.) 
                  Names are commonly descriptive and Latinised.
                  Species are often named after their discoverer, or an eminent figure in the discipline – but it is considered poor form to name a species after yourself.
                </p>
                <ul><li class="question">
                  Give your species a name – be creative!

                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>A diagnosis describes what makes your species unique.
                Ideally you would establish what makes it different from every other species in its genus (or if describing a new genus, what makes it distinct from every other genus in its family).
                For now, why not emphasise ways that it is different from the two fossils that you have just sketched.
                </p>
                <h4>Type material</h4>
                <p>Next, a single specimen must be designated the holotype.
                In the case of uncertainty, future fossil finds will be compared to the holotype to determine whether or not they belong to the same species. 
                As you only have one specimen, your choice of holotype is made for you.
                </p>

                  <li class="question">
                    If you had the choice, would the specimen make a good holotype?

                <h4>Testing your descriptive skills</h4>
                <p>
                  Congratulations!
                  Now all you need to do is publish your observations in a scientific journal and you will have described your first species.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now let’s put your descriptive skills to the test.
                  
                  One reason to take detailed sketches is so that you can answer new questions that might arise once you no longer have access to the original material.
                  With the help of the crib sheet, but looking only at the notes and sketches that you’ve made, can you assign the two specimens that you sketched earlier to a phylum, class and order?

                <p>
                  Solitary corals are difficult to identify from external features unless the growth form is very distinctive and/or details of septal arrangement can be clearly seen.
                  Among colonial corals, tabulate corals can usually be readily distinguished from rugose corals through the much smaller corallites of the former; corallite arrangements allow most tabulate corals to be separated into suborders.
                  Unless calical surfaces are particularly clear, detailed identification requires thin sections.

                  Bryozoans are a phylum of colonial marine invertebrates, loosely related to the brachiopods. Each individual bryozoan (a ‘zooid’) is around 0.5 millimetres long, but together they form colonies that can reach several centimetres in length.  They are filter feeders, sieving food particles from the water using their retractable lophophore (a basket of hair-lined tentacles). In many of the 4000 species alive today, zooids within a single colony are differentiated to perform different functions: some take care of the eating and excreting, for example; others do all the reproducing. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Almost all bryozoan species secrete mineralized skeletons, affording them an excellent fossil record that can be tracked back to the Ordovician period.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bryozoan colonies have a range of morphologies.
                  With reference to the papers and image gallery below,
                  and images / 3D models you can find yourself, make sketches that summarise the variety of colony morphology.  Can you find any colonies that show evidence of zooid specialization?
