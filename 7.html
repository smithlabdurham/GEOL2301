						<h2>Biogenic carbonates</h2>
						<p>
              One of life's biggest contributions to the geological record is the 
              production of vast volumes of skeletal carbonate.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this session we'll learn how water conditions control the taxonomic
              composition of carbonate producers, how a clever biological trick allows
              reefs to turn carbonate production into overdrive,
              and resolve the paradox of why the most diverse marine ecosystems thrive 
              in nutritional deserts.

                What is a reef?  It might be easy to know when you're swimming above one,
                but identifying a reef in the fossil record is a little more tricky:
                not least because the inside doesn't look quite like the outside.                
              </p>
              <p>
                Challenging the conception that a reef is purely a stack of corals
                growing ever upwards towards the light, coring studies have shown that
                the 'inside' of a reef is a jumble of broken fragments and cavities 
                filled with rubble and mud.  A 'framework' of skeletons is not always
                easy to recognize.

                Reefs are primarily constituted of the skeletons of 
                <strong>constructors</strong>,
                bound by <strong>binder</strong> organisms.  
                <strong>Bafflers</strong> reduce water speed close to the sediment surface,
                thus trapping fine particles, including those removed or excreted by 
                <strong>destroyers</strong>.  <strong>Dwellers</strong> take advantage of 
                the many open cavities within a reef framework – which may, on incorporation
                into the rock record, later house oil and gas deposits: reef rock has
                an excellent reservoir potential.

                  Despite warm temperatures through the summer, the air temperature falls
                  slightly below 15°&nbsp;C in winter across most of the Med.
                  If the sea water retained some of its summer warmth through the winter,
                  reefs might perhaps scrape by: but the high latitude (just over 
                  30°&nbsp;N) means that there's not enough winter sunlight to power
                  zooxanthellae.<br />
                  As a secondary consideration, much of the north and east basin is also 
                  clouded by riverine input – 
                  less so the south of the basin, into which the dry Sahara drains.
                  And a slightly elevated salinity, particularly in the evaporative
                  summer months, represents a further headwind.

                    of calcium carbonate into the rock record, filling sedimentary basins

                The presence of photosymbiotic <strong>zooxanthellae</strong> is what
                allows extant reef-building animals to maintain their phenomenal growth
                rates and produce reef rock in step with sea level change.

              <p>
                Zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates: single-celled red algae better known
                among palaeontologists for their rich palynological (i.e. microfossil)
                record.  Although dinoflagellates and their hosts can survive
                independently, both prosper when enjoying a mutualistic relationship:
                the algae process their hosts&rsquo; waste nutrients and carbonate ions to 
                produce sugars (i.e. energy) and oxygen.

                The productivity boost is so pronounced that a previous scheme classified
                corals as <strong>hermatypic</strong>
                (<strong>zooxanthellate</strong> and <strong>constructional</strong>, 
                i.e. reef-building) or
                <strong>ahermatypic</strong> (non-zooxanthellate and non-constructional).
                This represents a slight oversimplification: there exist zooxanthellate, 
                non-constructional corals, and non-zooxanthellate constructional corals;
                and in the fossil record, the presence of zooxanthellae is necessarily 
                conjectural.
                The strength of the association is nevertheless instructive; it is
                diffcult to manufacture enough carbonate to form a reef without 
                assistance from photosynthesis.

                  A stromatolite is a thickened mass of typically limestone mud
                  that is distinct from the surrounding strata, thus satisfying Dunham's
                  weak stratigraphic definition of a reef. 
                  But with the framework not comprising calcified organisms, and the
                  scarcity of cavities, it is a bit of a squeeze to fit a stromatolite
                  into the ecological definition.  But might the same be true of

                    <strong>Common ground</strong>: predominantly coral (i.e. anthozoan) 
                    framework; bound by calcifying red algae and bryozoans.  
                    Functionally and mechanically there seems to be a strong 
                    correspondence: it would take a time-traveller some careful
                    inspection to work out whether they were snorkelling over a
                    Palaeozoic, Mesozoic or Cenozoic reef.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Differences</strong>: Scleractinians are aragonitic, rather
                    than calcitic (as rugose &amp; tabulate corals); they re-invented
                    mineralization (convergent evolution!) so cannot be seen as a 
                    continuation of the Palaeozoic tradition.  
                    Stromatoporoids (filter feeders) and calcareous green algae 
                    (photosynthesizers) are obviously not direct equivalents or 
                    'replacements'.<br />
                    There is a stronger argument that Mesozoic and Cenozoic reefs are
                    continuous, owing to their common taxonomic constitution:
                    but where did these taxa reside during the Jurassic eclipse and the
                    domanince of rudists during the Cretaceous?  Were there holdouts
                    that didn't get preserved for some reason, perhaps around remote 
                    island arcs?  Or did the key taxa find non-reef roles and only 
                    "get back together" after the K-Pg mass extinction cleared the 
                    rudists from the scene?

                Reefs may secrete carbonate apace, but carbonates also form in cooler
                waters, and in settings that are not nutrient-starved.
                <strong>Cool-water carbonates</strong> are now recognized as an 
                important ecological and sedimentary setting in modern oceans,
                though a longstanding resistance to the concept has not been entirely purged
                from the literature; many settings traditionally interpreted as
                warm-water reefs await reevaluation through a cool-water carbonate lens.

                    Insofar as this is an ecological distinction, we might expect
                    to substitute extant heterotrophs for extinct analogues: e.g. sea fans for crinoids?

                  <p>
                    We know that there are some differences. Can we assume that the
                    substitution of scleractinians by Palaeozoic corals represents a
                    direct swap?  Possibly.
                    Do modern benthic forams and bryozoans have the same ecology as their
                    Mesozoic/Palaeozoic forebears?  
                    We might hope so, but we'd be speculating.
                    It may be riskier still to interpret stromatoporoids as 
                    an exclusively warm-water taxon, simply because they contribute to
                    the framework of Palaeozoic reefs.

                    Shallow water: water energy grinds down carbonate material to dust,

                    storms are infrequent enough, they may be preserved reasonably intact.

                  <p>
                    Below storm wave base, there may be fewer land-derived nutrients to
                    sustain suspension feeding organisms; calcifying photosynthesizers
                    begin to proliferate.  These will have increasingly delicate forms
                    as water depth (and thus interval between storms) increases.

                    Below the photic zone we see a lower abundance of life dominated by 
                    suspension feeders (sediment is being transported down slope and
                    raining from the water column) and characteristically bryozoans,
                    also known as "moss animals".
                    These will be very delicate forms, to maximize the amount of water
                    they can process – no need to worry about storm damage this deep.
                    Like moss on bare rock, bryozoans can trap fine particles,
                    which will be integrated into the sedimentary record.
